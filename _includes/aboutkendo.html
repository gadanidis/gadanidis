    <div class="large">

        <p> Kendo (剣道, Kendō, lit. 'sword way', 'sword path' or 'way of the sword') is a modern Japanese martial art, descended from kenjutsu (the Japanese martial art of swordsmanship), that uses bamboo swords (shinai) as well as protective armor (bōgu). Today, it is widely practiced within Japan and has spread to many other nations across the world. Kendo is an activity that combines martial arts practices and values with strenuous, sport-like physical activity. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendo" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>)
